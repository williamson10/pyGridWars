This is a very simple game project used for learning.

#Motivation
I am using this repo while I teach myself both Python and GitHub. 

#Description
This is a simple text based game. The "game" involves simply moving to locations in a grid and either gaining or losing health based on the current location. Locations are defined in the locations.json file.
